WORDNET examples

from nltk.corpus import wordnet as wn

for i in wn.synsets('tree'):
    print (i, i.definition(), i.examples(), i.lemmas())

# each i is a synset that follows the syntax as shown below, you can get the gloss, examples and lemma forms by invoking corresponding methods

tree = wn.synset('tree.n.01') # every synset in wordnet is represented as a 3-tuple where 1st entry is the word, 2nd entry is the part-of-speech and 3rd entry is the sense number (think of it as a unique ID associated with the word sense)

tree.hypernyms() # get all hypernyms
tree.hyponyms() # get all hyponyms
tree.part_holonyms() # get part holonym
tree.substance_holonyms() # get substance holonym
tree.part_meronyms() # PW relation
tree.sunstance_meronym() # made-of relation
